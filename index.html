                            <p>Having a bat that you feel a connection with is an amazing feeling but the hard part is finding one that suits your needs and playstyle. Choosing a table tennis bat, especially your first, can sometimes feel like solving a complicated equation but in this page I will explain the main concepts
                                and hopefully make the whole process much easier. 
                            </p>
                            <h2>SPIN, SPEED, CONTROL</h2>                        
                        </header>
                        <main>
                            <!-- You can have 2 mains !!! provided they are not in the same nest(prevous main was nested in body tag) -->
                            <p>Without a doubt the most important propties are SPIN , SPEED, CONTROL !! Speed is self-explanatory, a faster shot is harder for your opponent to
                            react to and controlling a fast shot isn't particularly easy either. Control is a bit vague as despite its simple 
                            name there's no real way to quanitify it exactly and most of it determined by the player and not the bat in my opinion however, 
                            the type of bat used defintely does play a part in the control aspect. Spin makes the ball react to your opponents rubber upon 
                            contact. The reaction depends on spin you produce and in general; backspin makes the ball go down and into the net, sidespin 
                            causes the ball to go either left of right, topspin makes the ball pop high and often out of the table. Obviously each spin can
                            be countered/responded to by simpling adjusting your bat angle but this comes with experience. As you can see spin plays an extermely important
                            part to the game and the rubber is the only part of the bat that affects the spin.

                        <h1>Blades</h1>

                        <h2>Blade Thickness</h2>
                        <p>A table tennis blade is comprised of wood and some composite materials. The first consideration for a table tennis
                            blade is the ply. What is a ply you may ask ? It is the number of layers in the blade and the general rule is that
                            the more ply the more layers and thus the bat will be faster however, this will cause the bat to be heavier. The next consideration is 
                            the materials used. As complicated as it sounds the problem can be broken down into 2 catergories for begineers. If the blade contains some kind of 
                            carbon or carbon fibre composite then, the blade will be stiffer but produce more speed thus making it harder to control. Essential carbon fibre materials provide a trade off more speed, less control. This will be a common trade you will not just for the materials but for the rubber and blade aswell.
                            Blade thickness is similar to ply. The thicker the blade the more power. Generally speaking
                            a blade with a thickness below 6mm alllows for more spin and control due to its weight whereas, above 6mm allows for more agressive and faster plays.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Blade Handle</h2>
                        <img width = "100%" height="40%" src = "https://www.megaspin.net/store/extra/handles.png" alt="The four main handle types">
                        <p>Next is the shape of the blade handle, the main 4 categories are Flared, Straight, Anatomic, Penhold. The flared handle is the most common handle amoung the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis_grips_and_playing_styles" style = "color: #fff; text-decoration: none;"target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">shakehand grip</a>
                            users. Its most noticeable feature is the widening of the grip as you go down, this allows for a more secure grip and lowers the probabilty for the bat to fall out of one's hand.
                            A straight handle has a constant cross section and lets players <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ_IU5Hktsw"  style =  "color: #fff; text-decoration: none;"target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">twiddle</a> easier.
                            It is more commonly used amoung top european players. An Anatomic handle has a bump in the middle and some people find it more comfortable.
                            Last but certainly not least the penhold handle. The penhold handle is mainly used for penhold grip players.
                            Occasionally the blade may come with an offense or defense rating these are often good indicators of the speed-spin trade off. An agressive blade is faster and harder to control etc.

                        <h1>Rubbers</h1>
                        <img src="https://www.teessport.com/images/products/1616497721-68955800.jpg" width="100%" height= "30%"alt="A table tennis rubber">
                        <h2>Rubber Type</h2>
                        <p>
                            Rubbers are an extermely important part of the bat they essential dictate what type of reaction the ball has when in contact with the ball.
                            First one will need to think about the type of rubber. The main four types of rubbers are inverted,short pipmple,long pimple,anti-spin.
                            Most people use inverted as it is the one that lets people learn the fundmentals of the game. Inverted rubbers respond to spin how I explained in the spin section. The key to remember is that when the ball bounces off an inverted rubber its spin direction is reversed. For example if a topspin ball comes at a inverted rubber the returning ball(provided no technique applied) will also have topspin because both the direction of the ball and the spin direction of the ball have been reversed.
                            This allows me to explain that a pimpled rubber does the opposite, it does not reverse the spin direction so in the previous example the returning ball would come back with backspin. The difference between long and short pimples is that long pimple don't react to spin as much as a short pimple. In the previous the long pimple rubber would return more backspin because it almost doesn't change anything about the spin of ball whereas a short pimple would decrease the spin a bit.
                            Antispin rubbers are rare but as the name suggests they don't react to spin and often older ones remove the spin on the ball.
                            Each rubber beside inverted has a certain playstyle preference. An inverted rubber can be used for any playstyle. Long pimple and short pimple are used as defensive rubbers to make chopping easier, the difference being that short pimples are easier to attack with.
                            Antispin is seen as a gimmick by some but is useful as a defensive rubber and not having to worry about the opponents spin(this one can be a double edged sword).
                        </p>
                        <h2>Sponge Thickness</h2>
                        <img src="http://butterflyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/RGthickness-300x180.jpg" width="100%" height="30%" alt="Recommendations of sponge thickness">
                        <p>
                            Sponge are simpler to understand, the thicker/harder the sponge the more faster and agressive it is.
                            An important note that is that a harder sponge will produce more spin it just harder to due its weight and difficulty in control.
                            As shown in the image above a good recommendation is 1.5mm-1.7mm thickness for an all-rounder , 1.9mm and above for agressive and anything below 1.3mm is defensive.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Region</h2>
                        <p>
                            Suprisingly the region of where the rubber orginates from has an affect. Often european rubber are softer sponges and less tackier.
                            Tackiness is essential how sticky the rubber, the more tackier the easier it is to produce spin. Asian rubbers are the opposite. European faster, Asian spinner. Some people recommend european on the forehand and asian on the backhand, other say the opposite or both sides to be the same. This all completly opinion so just do whatever you feel is best.
                            However an important thing to remember is that some european rubbers especially from Butterfly come with a higher tension feature on the rubber. Some noteable examples are the Tenergy,Dignics and Rozena series. These rubbers cause for extra springness effect being the ball will bounce more off the bat which, makes the bat good for faster plays but make controlling the much harder ESPECIALLY for beginners! 

                            Side note: There's no real way to know how senstive a rubber is to spin but it makes a big impact. The tips I would advise would be the more tackier or the more spin it can produce, the more senstive it is to spin. Being more sensitive to spin lets you learn about how to control spin.

                        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                        <img src="https://i.natgeofe.com/n/21db17f6-81d6-4127-85d4-6785a57b3616/climb-mount-denali-alaska_16x9.jpg?w=1200" width="100%" height="30%" alt="Conclusion">
                        <p>The two final considerations are pricing and pre built vs custom made. European rubbers tend to be more expensive especially tension ones. Any carbon fibre blade is also going to very expensive.
                            Pre built bat vs custom bat is completly up to the buyer. All I can say is that when buying a custom bat paying 1-5 pounds from the provider (or for free if you have a kind coach to do it in person) to get the bat built instead glueing it yourself is very useful.
                            Hopefully this summaries all the things to take account to let you make a better informed decision. My personal recommendation for a beginner is the <a href="https://palioett.com/product/palio-expert-3-bat-case-expert-table-tennis/"style="color: #fff; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Palio Expert 3.0 or 2.0</a> bat.
                            Some beginner rubbers are DHS hurricane 3, Rozena (with a thinner sponge around 1.7-1.9mm).As for a blade an all wood blade with an all rounder playstyle. Just remember these are only recommendations.
                            I have put some popular brands below if you wish to explore. Thank you reading and I hope go on out there enjoy the bat decision process but importantly enjoy the beatiful game.
